# Tools

The plugin registers these DSH tools:

- `reca_create_video`: submit a natural-language story and RunConfig.
- `reca_create_video_interactive`: collect up to three material preferences,
  review a Creative Brief through Harness, and submit only after approval.
- `reca_get_status`: return Gateway state plus ReCA stage, video state, audit state, and manifest.
- `reca_cancel`: request SIGTERM, then SIGKILL after the configured grace period.
- `reca_resume`: resume an interrupted, cancelled, or failed run from its run directory.
- `reca_list_runs`: list persisted runs.
- `reca_get_artifact`: return the manifest or a complete artifact URL.

`reca_create_video` accepts optional visual inputs in addition to the story:

```json
{
  "story": "...",
  "first_frame": "/path/to/start.png",
  "reference_images": [
    {"path": "/path/to/hero.png", "role": "character", "name": "hero"},
    {"url": "https://example.com/scene.png", "role": "scene", "name": "battlefield"}
  ]
}
```

The ReCA-compatible aliases `first_url` and `reference_image_urls` are also
accepted. If both names are present, the product names (`first_frame` and
`reference_images`) take precedence.

The Gateway copies local images into the isolated run directory and records an
`input_manifest.json`. It never puts image bytes or provider credentials into
the DSH model context. `first_frame` is optional; without it, ReCA generates
the first anchor as before. Reference-image forwarding follows the ReCA
planner and serial segment contract. The Wan3.0 adapter maps I2V to one
reference image. For R2V it sends the current frame as `reference_image[0]`,
then appends up to three planner-selected references and prefixes the prompt to
make the first image's temporal role explicit. This is a soft start constraint;
the deployed Wan3.0 API does not accept a hard `first_frame` together with
additional `reference_image` entries. Bridge requests still use the real
first/last-frame pair.

`reca_start` and `reca_status` remain compatibility aliases.

## Interactive creation

Use `reca_create_video_interactive` only when the user asks to be questioned or
to approve the creative direction before generation. The model supplies the
known story and structured `brief`, plus zero to three missing preference
questions. The plugin asks those questions through `ctx.userQuestions`, renders
the answers into a Creative Brief, and opens a native `plan-review` card.

Approval compiles the original story, structured brief, audio intent,
continuity/camera constraints, must-have/must-avoid lists, and human answers
into the persisted upstream story. Backend, resolution, aspect ratio, seed,
and routing controls remain Gateway options. Interactive defaults are
`backend=wan`, `force_i2v=false`, `resolution=1280x720`, `aspect_ratio=16:9`,
and `enable_audit=true`.

A revision response returns `state=awaiting_revision` without a `run_id`.
Dismissal, cancellation, a missing UI provider, or a delegated live agent
causes the tool call to fail closed. None of those paths creates a Gateway run.
